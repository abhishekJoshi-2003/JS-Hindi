DOM -> Document Object Model

--> This is the Modal which describes about the structure of the page. How a page woule look like.
--> When we go to chrome inspect and write  
    console.log(window); --> It would give a lot of information about the information that the wwindow is taking
    console.log(window.document) or console.log(document) --> It would give documentary information
    console.dir(document) --> It would give more detailed information

                                                            text node

--> In inspect console --
    console.log(document.______) // when we replace _______ with the property of the document then we would get the information
--> We can manipulate the DOM in some ways
