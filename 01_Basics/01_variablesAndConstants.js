const id = 10001 //This is a constant field which can not be changed in the program
let name = "Abhishek Joshi" //This is a Good Practise as it avoids the block and functional block scope
var age = 10; //This is not a Good Approach
friend = "Nandan" //This is also a way to declare variable but a very bad practise
let known;
//id = 1002 This is not allowed
console.log("Id is " + id)
console.table([id,name,age,friend,known])

/*
In such a way variables work
whenever you do not give value to a Variable then it is considered as undefined in JS
